Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

Getting Started & Documentation
-------------------------------
Documentation is available on the [Terraform website](http://www.terraform.io):
  - [Intro](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)
  - [Docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)

If you're new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) on HashiCorp's learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#operations-and-development) to continue your learning.

Show off your Terraform knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the [certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/) for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/certification/terraform-associate) on HashiCorp's learning platform.

Developing Terraform
--------------------

This repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine. Providers are implemented as plugins that each have their own repository in [the `terraform-providers` organization](https://github.com/terraform-providers) on GitHub. Instructions for developing each provider are in the associated README file. For more information, see [the provider development overview](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/provider.html).

To learn more about compiling Terraform and contributing suggested changes, please refer to [the contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The `hashicorp/setup-terraform` action is a JavaScript action that sets up Terraform CLI in your GitHub Actions workflow by:

- Downloading a specific version of Terraform CLI and adding it to the `PATH`.
- Configuring the [Terraform CLI configuration file](/docs/commands/cli-config.html) with a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise hostname and API token.
- Installing a wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls of the `terraform` binary and expose its STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code as outputs named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` respectively. (This can be optionally skipped if subsequent steps in the same job do not need to access the results of Terraform commands.)

After you've used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run arbitrary Terraform commands using [the GitHub Actions `run` syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun). This allows most Terraform commands to work exactly like they do on your local command line.

Steps for initial build and commands:
- cd practice-1
- terraform init
- terraform plan -out=practice-1
- terraform apply -auto-approve
- terraform destroy -auto-approve

Please use above commands to build and deploy
